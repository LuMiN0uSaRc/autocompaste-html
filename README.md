Assignment 1 - CS4249 

Most of the code has been left unchanged. 
The main parts that have been editted are the different HTML files: 
1. experiment.html 
-> Edited to add in a new variable 

2. index.html 
-> Editd the content of the page 

3. instructions.html 
-> Edited the content of the page 

4. questionnaire-post.html
-> Edited the content of the page 

5. questionnaire-pre.html 
-> Edited the content of the page 

Another file I have mainly edited is the interface.js file in order to change the number of windows that will appear, and as well as changing the color of the windows as well. There are also some small changes to the code such as ACPToolKit to make sure the window and colors are parsed correctly as well into the data. 

All the experiment files have been edited, and since my experiment require 6 participants, 6 set of tests are created to cover the cases that I have planned out (mentioned in the main design document), whereby there are 3 blocks and 3 trials. Each participant will be doing different content. The content of the articles have also been edited by me as well. 

There are also pictures added as well in order to add on to my instructions, making it more visual appealing and easier to understand how does the experiment works.
