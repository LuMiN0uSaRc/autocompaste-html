Breaking, also called Breakdancing or b-boying, is an athletic style of street dance.

The Toprock is a set of moves which are performed in a standing position. Toprock moves are generally easier and are used by the b-boys as a warm up before the real stuff starts.

Breakdancing is typically set to hip-hop, funk, and breakbeat music, although modern trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns.

Foot work is comprises a set of moves that the dancer performs with his feet while he is standing or on the floor.

While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, breakdancing mainly consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves, and freezes.

The dance spread worldwide due to popularity in the media, especially in regions such as Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United Kingdom.

The drops are where the dancer 'drops' from the standing position, down to the floor to perform the next set of moves.

Floor rocks are transition moves that involve intricate and stylish footwork. 

The power moves are where the b-boy goes into a spinning motion. They are usually the toughest moves, and the judges rate the dancer on the perfection with which he makes these moves.

Freeze is a technique in which the dancer momentarily pauses in a balance challenging or intriguing position. There are innumerable variations of this technique and of course, you can always come up with your own body contorting move and just hold for a couple of seconds.

A dancer may choose to end the dance routine by pretending to fall down and loose control of himself. To make a 'suicide' look effective, it must look painful, as if while performing you have really hit yourself.
