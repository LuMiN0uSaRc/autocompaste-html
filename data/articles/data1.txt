Agumon is a Reptile Digimon. It has grown up and become able to walk on two legs, and has an appearance like a tiny dinosaur.

It has grown hard, sharp claws on both its hands and feet, and demonstrates its power in battle. 

Because it is still on the way to adulthood, its power is low, but as its personality is quite ferocious, it doesn't understand fear.

It is also a being that foretells Digivolution to a great and powerful Digimon.

Agumon is a short and stout Tyrannosaurus rex-like Digimon standing about 3 feet tall, and has amber orange skin and light green eyes. 

It also has flattened forearms with broad, three-clawed hands, though early artwork for the Digimon virtual pet depicted its hands with four claws, and distinct pectoral muscles.

Its legs and arms are shown to be very vascular. Its tail is stubby, and its head and snout are almost as large as the rest of its body.

Agumon digivolves from Koromon, and can digivolve into Greymon, Meramon, Birdramon, Centarumon, Monochromon, or Tyrannomon depending on its stats.

As with other Rookie digimon, it can also digivolve into Numemon when it doesn't meet the stat requirements of other Champion level Digimon. It can also digivolve to Sukamon if it's Virus bar is completely filled.

Agumon digivolves into Greymon, then MetalGreymon and finally WarGreymon or Omnimon depending on its DP. Agumon is one of the only rookies that are not seen in any domains.
